## **Title**

### Vehicle Damage Detection Using AI-Enabled Camera Systems

---

## **Opening Background Information**

✅ - This project is designed to address a significant challenge in the automotive and insurance industries: efficient and accurate detection of vehicle damage. Vehicle damage assessment often relies on manual inspection, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error. By leveraging AI-based systems for automated damage detection, this project aims to revolutionize how vehicle damage is identified and reported. This project stems from a personal observation of inefficiencies in car insurance claim processes and vehicle maintenance inspections.

## **General Description of the Current Project**

✅ - The goal is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of automatically identifying and classifying vehicle damages through image recognition. The AI system will be trained using a dataset of various vehicle damage types and integrated into camera-enabled systems, such as roadside cameras, vehicle dashcams, or dedicated inspection stations. The system will streamline insurance claims, reduce processing times, and minimize human errors, thereby increasing the efficiency of damage assessment in automotive industries.

## **Proposed Idea for Enhancements to the Project**

✅ - **AI-based automated damage classification system**  
In the current vehicle inspection process, manual identification of damages can lead to inconsistencies and delays. By using a deep learning model, the system can quickly and accurately analyze images, classify damages, and generate reports. This minimizes the reliance on manual labor and accelerates the entire process.

✅ - **Scalable and adaptable architecture**  
This project provides a flexible system capable of identifying not only common damage types (e.g., scratches, dents) but also more complex damages (e.g., structural cracks) through iterative learning. The scalable model can be adapted to different vehicle models and regional conditions, ensuring wide applicability in diverse contexts.

## **Value and Significance of the Project**

✅ - Vehicle damage detection is a critical component of automotive maintenance and insurance claims. The current manual process is time-intensive and subjective. Automating this process using AI:
- Reduces time for damage assessment and reporting.
- Minimizes disputes in insurance claims through objective analysis.
- Enhances road safety by identifying vehicle damage before it leads to critical failures.
- Contributes to sustainability by ensuring timely repair and reducing wastage of materials.

---

## **Current Limitations**

✅ - Current challenges in vehicle damage detection systems include:
1. Variability in damage appearances due to lighting, weather, or camera quality.
2. Limited datasets that may not encompass all vehicle types, damage scenarios, or rare cases.
3. Difficulty in detecting internal damages that are not visible externally.
4. Challenges in distinguishing cosmetic damages from critical structural issues.

---

## **Literature Review**

✅ - Development of AI models for damage detection requires:
- Extensive image datasets of vehicle damages under diverse conditions.
- Research on object detection and classification techniques.
- Analysis of existing methodologies in damage assessment to identify gaps and areas of improvement.
- Collaboration with automotive and insurance industries for real-world application and feedback.

## **Image Acquisition Method**

1. **Direct Capture**  
   Images and videos are obtained by photographing vehicles with visible damage using a high-resolution camera.  
2. **Dataset Augmentation**  
   Additional images are sourced through public datasets and web searches to enhance diversity.

### Example Dataset Sources:
- **[Google Drive - Vehicle Damage DataSet](https://drive.google.com/drive/)**  
- **[Open Vehicle Dataset - Damage Examples](https://opendata.com/vehicles/damage)**

## **Model Training Setup**

### **1. Dataset Preparation**
- Organize images and labels into folders (e.g., `train`, `valid`).
- Ensure proper alignment between image and label filenames.

### **2. Train the Model**
Use the YOLOv5 framework for training:
```bash
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 300 --data ./data/data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
